c# vs .NET

c# is a programming language
.NET is framework to develop application - supports different languages - c#, f#, VB.NET...

.NET - CLR (Common Language Runtime) & Class library

C# code -> Compilation -> Intermediate Language (machine independent)
(similar to the ByteCode in Java)

CLR translates IL to machine code - Just In Time (JIT) compilation

Architecture of .NET app:
Application has classes
Class has Data and Methods

Namespace - container of related classes
Assembly (DLL or EXE) - container of namespaces

when we compile an application, it will provide 1/more assemblies(dll or exe) based on 1/more namespaces
